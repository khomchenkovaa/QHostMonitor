      You can use this test to compare two files or to search a string in the file. 6 alert conditions are available:<br>
      <ul class=olist00>
       <li> alert when files are different<br>
       <li> alert when files are identical<br>
       <li> alert when 1st file contains 2nd (in any position)<br>
       <li> alert when 1st file does not contain 2nd<br>
       <li> alert when file contains a specified string
       <li> alert when file does not contain a specified string
      </ul>
	  <p align="justify">
      You can specify one or more parameters to compare files: compare time, compare size, compare contents.
      If you set "compare contents" option but don't set "compare size" option, KharmonMonitor will consider two files are identical when
      one file includes another one at offset 0 (one file can be smaller then another one).<br><br>

      If you need to check some files that are dynamically created and do not have static name (e.g. some logs that
       are created on daily basis and have different file name every day), you may enable "Translate macros" options.
       With this option enabled you may use special date macro variables, file-specific variables and User Defined Variables in file name.<br><br>

	  When you use Compare Files test to check file for some specific string, you should tell KharmonMonitor what encoding was used for the 
	   file. KharmonMonitor supports several encoding methods:
	<ul class=olist00>
	 <li>ASCII
	 <li>UTF-8
	 <li>UTF-16
	 <li>UTF-16 big endian
	 <li>UTF-32
	 <li>UTF-32 big endian
	</ul>
	<br>
	Note 1 (file encoding)<br>
	 &nbsp; ASCII - each character represented by single byte; <br>
	 &nbsp; UTF-8 - variable-length character encoding for Unicode;<br>
	 &nbsp; UTF-16 - all characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane encoded by 2 bytes;<br>
	 &nbsp; UTF-32 - each Unicode character is represented by exactly 4 bytes.<br><br>

	Note 2 (Unicode support): KharmonMonitor gets information regarding current code page used on the system when you setup test item. If you check Unicode
 	 file, KharmonMonitor translates string to Unicode using stored code page.<br><br>

	Note 3 (UNIX):
      If you want to perform the test using an agent installed on UNIX-like system, you should have in mind:
      <ul class=olist00>
       <li> use slash (/) in the path (instead of backslash (\) that you are using on Windows systems);
       <li> on UNIX-like systems name of the file is case sensitive (so "/etc/RMA" and "/etc/rma" are different files);	   
      </ul>
