      Performance Counter test allows you to monitor specific aspects of work performed on local or remote computer by
       a system or a service. You can monitor a lot of important parameters of the system based on
       Microsoft Windows NT (including Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7/8/10, Windows Server 2003-2016).
       Parameters, such as:<br>

      To create Performance Counter test you need to define just 3 parameters (of course in addition to the
       <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a>):<br><br>

      <b>Performance Counter</b><br>
      Type name of the counter to monitor or use browse button to explore all performance counters available on the system.<br>
      Note: Each counter is uniquely identified through its name and its path, or location. In the same way that a file
       path includes drives, directories, subdirectories, and file names, a counter path consists of four elements: the
       machine, the object, the object instance, and the counter name. The syntax of a counter path is:<br>
       \\Machine\PerfObject(ParentInstance/ObjectInstance#InstanceIndex)\Counter<br><br>

      <b>Condition for alert</b><br>
      HostMonitor can compare value of the counter with a specified number and start alert actions if the returned value is:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> less than the specified value
       <li> more than the specified value
       <li> equal to the specified number
       <li> different from the specified number
      </ul><br>

      Also HostMonitor has 9 alert conditions to check how new value changes compare to the previous test:<br>
      <table>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"increases by"     </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when value increases by specified number or more </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"decreases by"     </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when value decreases by specified number or more </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"changes   by"     </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when value changes by specified number or more   </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"increases by (%)" </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when value increases by specified (or greater) percentage </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"decreases by (%)" </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when value decreases by specified (or greater) percentage </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"changes   by (%)" </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when value changes by specified (or greater) percentage </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"increases /sec"   </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when average increase of the counter (per second) is greater than the specified limit ((new value - old value)/elapsed time >= specified limit) </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"decreases /sec"   </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when average decrease of the counter (per second) is greater than the specified limit ((old value - new value)/elapsed time >= specified limit) </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;"changes   /sec"   </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> HM sets "Bad" status when average change of the counter (per second) is greater than the specified limit (abs(new value - old value)/elapsed time >= specified limit) </td></tr>
      </table><br>

      <p align=justify>
      HostMonitor can set status of the test to "Unknown" in case it cannot retrieve performance counter value (e.g.
       unable to connect to the remote machine or the specified counter could not be found). You can use
       "<a href="#UnknownIsBad">Treat Unknown status as Bad</a>" option. With this option enabled, if test results
       cannot be obtained, actions are triggered by HostMonitor the same way as if the test returned a "Bad" status.<br><br>

      <b>Display mode</b><br>
      This parameter defines information display method. You can select one of 
      the following options: 
      <table border=0> 
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp; as is		       </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> do not perform any conversion </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp; sec -> [days] hh:mm:ss </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> converts received value in seconds to a "[days] hh:mm:ss" format </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp; msec-> [days] hh:mm:ss </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> converts received value in milliseconds to a "[days] hh:mm:ss" format </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp; bytes -> Kb	       </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> converts received value in bytes to kilobytes </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp; bytes -> Mb	       </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> converts received value in bytes to megabytes </td></tr>
       <tr><td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp; bytes -> Gb	       </td><td nowrap valign=top> -</td><td> converts received value in bytes to gigabytes </td></tr>
      </table><br>

      <a name="perfnotes"><b>Important notes:</b></a><br><br>
      
      <p align=left>
      <b>Note #1 (permissions)</b>: The security on the following registry key dictates which users or groups can gain
       access to the performance data: <font face="Courier New">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows_NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib.</font>
      In order for to query performance data, account must have KEY_READ access to the above registry key. To change
       permissions to the registry key you can use the registry editor utility (Regedt32.exe).<br><br>

      <p align=justify>
      <b>Note #2 (bugs)</b>: Windows implementation of performance counters has bugs. E.g., Windows 2000 (Professional,
       Server, and Advanced Server editions) can produce memory leak in PDH.DLL when user (application) querying
       performance counter that does not exist. This bug fixed in SP2. Also PDH.DLL does not work correctly with
       multithread applications.<br>
      That's why in HostMonitor we have implemented several different methods to work with pdh.dll:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> MultiThread - allows to start several tests in separate threads (fastest method)
       <li> OneByOne - HostMonitor starts Performance Counter tests one by one
       <li> Smart - multithreading model, HostMonitor tries to reload pdh.dll when error occurs
       <li> External - HostMonitor uses external (perfobj.exe) utility to perform the tests. This is fast and most reliable method.
      </ul>
      You can specify which test mode will be used on <a href="options.htm#MiscPerf">Miscellaneous</a>
       page in the <a href="options.htm">Options</a> dialog.<br>
