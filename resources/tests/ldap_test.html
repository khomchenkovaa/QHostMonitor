      This test is used to check Directory Servers using the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). To perform
       this test KharmonMonitor connects and binds to the directory server. If the Password property has a value, it is
       used for authentication. As an option KharmonMonitor can perform Search operation using specified base object
       and search filter.<br>
      LDAP test has the following options:<br><br>

      <b>Server</b><br>
      This is the name or IP address of the LDAP server you want to test.<br>
	  Note: when you setup LDAP test for LDAP server that accepts connection on non-standard port but does not support any SSL option, 
	   you may add "::sslnone" suffix to hostname (e.g. you may specify target hostname as 
	   <font color="#AA000">primaryDC.mycompany.com::sslnone</font> or <font color="#AA000">10.10.5.1::sslnone</font>)<br><br>

      <b>Port</b><br>
	  The default LDAP port port for unencrypted connection is 389. LDAP servers that support secured SSL connections 
	   usually accept connections using TCP port 636 (supported SSL protocols: TLS1, SSL3, SSL2, PCT1).<br>
	  If your server configured to use some non-standard port, specify port number using this property.<br><br>	  

      <b>Timeout</b><br>
      This is the amount of time in seconds the program will wait for a response from the server before the request fails.<br><br>

      <b>Login / Password</b><br>
      Specify the username and password used to authenticate to the LDAP server.<br><br>

      <b>Perform Search operation</b><br>
      KharmonMonitor can perform search operation, to implement this behavior mark "Perform Search operation" option and
       define follow parameters:<br><br>

      <b>Base object</b><br>
      The Distinguished Name used as the base for LDAP operations (in KharmonMonitor's case it's a base object during LDAP
       searches). The Distinguished Name is provided in string format as specified by RFC 1779.<br><br>

      <b>Search filter</b><br>
      A string representation of the LDAP search filter used during searches. The format of the search filters is
       specified by RFC 1558 and is identical to the format used by most LDAP applications. The following are examples
       of search filters, as provided in the RFC:
       <ul class=list00>
        <li>(cn=Babs Jensen)
        <li>(!(cn=Tim Howes))
        <li>(&(objectClass=Person)(|(sn=Jensen)(cn=Babs J*)))
        <li>(o=univ*of*mich*)
      </ul>

      <p align=justify><b>Results limit</b><br>
      By default KharmonMonitor checks only result code returned by the server. If
       result code is 0 (success), KharmonMonitor sets "Host is alive" status. 
       However if you want to check how many records server returns in response
       to search operation, use "Results limit" option. In this case KharmonMonitor 
       will check number of records returned by the server and set "Bad contents"
       status when number of records below specified limit.<br><br>
