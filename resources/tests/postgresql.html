      KharmonMonitor can test your SQL servers. It supports PostgreSQL servers.<br>
	  Servers are checked by logging into (and out) of the server. You should specify the server name, database, user name and password.<br><br>
      
      In order to monitor PostgreSQL servers KharmonMonitor uses the PostgreSQL Call Interface (libpq.dll), you should have the PostgreSQL client software installed on the computer.<br><br>
      
     PostgreSQL test methods may display "unknown" status and appropriate error message in the Reply field when it was impossible to perform the check (e.g. when client library is not installed).<br><br>
