      Check the UNC path (or local folder) for availability;
      for the total amount of free space; or for the amount of free space
      available to the current user
      (if the operating system implements per-user quotas, this value may be
      less than the total number of free bytes on the disk).
      For this test you have to specify the UNC path (or local folder) that you wish
      to be checked and select the condition for the alert: <br>
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> when the resource is unavailable<br>
       <li> when free space (for current user) is less than a specified value<br>
       <li> when the total free space is less than a specified value
      </ul><br>

      If you want to perform the test using an <a href="rma-unix/index.htm" target="_blank">agent</a> installed on UNIX-like system, you should have in mind:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> use slash (/) in the path (instead of backslash (\) that you are using on Windows systems);
       <li> on UNIX-like systems name of the file is case sensitive (so "/etc/RMA" and "/etc/rma" are different files);
      </ul><br>
