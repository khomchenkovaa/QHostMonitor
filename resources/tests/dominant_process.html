	Unlike test methods that allow you to check specific process (Process test, Performance Counter, WMI) or 
	 total/average resource usage on the system (CPU Usage, WMI), Dominant Process test allows you to check on 
	 regular basis what process exactly uses the most of system resources. This test allows you to find out which 
	 process uses the most of CPU, Handles, Threads, Memory, Virtual memory or Address space.<br>
	HostMonitor provides information about "top process" - process that uses more resources that any other 
	 process on the system; it may display amount of allocated resources, process name and or process ID.<br>
	In addition to the <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a> the Dominant Process test has the following options:<br><br>

    <b>Check processes on...</b><br>
	Specify name or an IP address of the target computer (the target computer name must be prefixed by "\\"), or 
	 select the "&lt;local computer&gt;" item. You can use the "Browse network" button to select a computer from 
	 the list.<br><br>

	<b>Exclude process(es)</b><br>
	Here you may tell HostMonitor to exclude some processes from check by providing comma separated list of such processes, e.g. 
	 <font color="#AA0000">iexplore.exe, avp.exe, sql.exe</font>.
	If some process name includes comma, use quotation marks for such process. E.g. <font color="#AA0000">"test,alert.exe"</font>
 	 - name of single process<br>
	Also you may use expression like <span class="samplered">firefox.exe<b>[800 MB]</b>, oracle.exe<b>[8 GB]</b></span>.
	 Expressions in square brackets tell HostMonitor to exclude firefox.exe and oracle.exe processes from check UNLESS firefox uses over 
	  800 MB or oracle uses over 8 GB (memory). Similar expressions can be applied when the test checks for processes are using the most 
	  CPU, Handles or Threads; e.g. <span class="samplered">svchost.exe[30 %]</span> or <span class="samplered">chrome.exe[4000]</span>
	<br>	 
	When you need to monitor many instances of some specific application, you may use "Exclude processes" option to exclude ALL but 
	 specified process(es). Type string like <span class="samplered"><b>all but</b> processname.exe</span> You may check several 
	 processes using string like <span class="samplered"><b>all but</b> iexplore.exe, avp.exe</span><br><br>
	 
    <b>Alert if process utilizes over...</b><br>
	Here you should specify what kind of resources should be monitored and the maximum limit of resources. If any 
	 process uses resources over the limit, HostMonitor will change test status from Ok to Bad and start alerts 
	 if necessary (e.g. you may setup HostMonitor to use "kill" utility to terminate or restart any application 
	 that uses 60 or more percents of CPU).<br>
	You may check the following resources: <br>
	- CPU load<br>
	- Handles<br>
	- Threads<br>
	- Memory<br>
	- Virtual memory<br>
	- Address space<br><br>

    <b>Top process info:</b><br>
	HostMonitor provides information about "top process" (process that uses more resources that any other process 
	 on the system) using Reply field of the test item. You may choose one of the following options:<br>
	- process ID<br>
	- process name<br>
	- process name and process ID<br>
	- value (amount of resources used by the process)<br>
	- value and process ID<br>
	- value and process name<br>
	- value, process name and process ID<br>
	Also, there are 3 <a href="actions.htm#macro">macro variables</a> that can be used as parameters of the action (%ProcessName%, %ProcessID% and %ProcessOwner%).<br><br> 

    <b>Connect as</b><br>
	To check processes on remote Windows system you can mark this option and provide a username and a password 
	 for a connection to the target computer. On the other hand, we recommend using the <a href="profiles.htm#conmgr">Connection Manager</a>
	 that provides one convenient place to store account information necessary to perform connections to remote systems.<br><br>

	Note: To monitor processes on local or remote Windows system, make sure you have the WMI Core software package
 	 installed on the system. WMI Core is installed by default on Windows ME/2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10 and Windows Server 2003-2016. 
	 The WMI Core software package for Windows 95, 98, and Windows NT 4.0 is available at Microsoft's 
	 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=AFE41F46-E213-4CBF-9C5B-FBF236E0E875" target="_blank">web site</a>
	 site. Please note: WMI CORE for Windows 95/98/NT requires Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 or later.<br><br>
