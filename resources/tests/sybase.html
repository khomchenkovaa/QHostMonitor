      HostMonitor can test your SQL servers. It supports Sybase servers.<br>
	  Servers are checked by logging into (and out) of the server. You should specify the server name, database, user name and password.<br>
      See also <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters.</a><br><br>
      
      In order to monitor Sybase servers HostMonitor uses the Sybase Call Interface (libsybdb.dll), you should have the Sybase client software installed on the computer.<br><br>
      
      Sybase test methods may display "unknown" status and appropriate error message in the Reply field when it was impossible to perform the check (e.g. when client library is not installed).
