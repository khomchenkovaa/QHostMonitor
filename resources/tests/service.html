     Microsoft Windows NT* and UNIX systems supports an application type known as a service. It can be started automatically at system boot, by a user, or by an application that uses the service functions. Services can execute even when no user is logged on to the system.<br>
     Here "Windows NT" means system based on NT technology, including Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000/XP, Windows Vista/7/8/10, Windows Server 2003-2016.

      Service test may work in 3 modes:<br><br>

	<b>Alert when service not started</b><br>
	KharmonMonitor checks specific service state. If the service is not Running, KharmonMonitor will set Bad status and start the specified 
	 alert actions.<br>
	You may type name of the service to check, or select a service from the drop-down list. Note: when you setup NEW Service test item, 
	 you may specify several services; in such case KharmonMonitor will create separate test item for each selected OS service.<br><br>

	<b>Alert when service not started or does not respond</b><br>
	This mode used by default. KharmonMonitor checks service state and responsiveness. If the service has not been started or the service 
	 does not answer, KharmonMonitor will set Bad status and start the specified alert actions.<br>
	You may type name of the service to check, or select a service from the drop-down list. Note: when you setup NEW Service test item,
