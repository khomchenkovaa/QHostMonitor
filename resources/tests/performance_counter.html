    <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">Performance Counter</h2>
      Performance Counter test allows you to monitor specific aspects of work performed on local or remote computer by
       a system or a service. You can monitor a lot of important parameters of the system based on
       Microsoft Windows NT (including Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7/8/10, Windows Server 2003-2016).
       Parameters, such as:<br>
      <ul class=list00><br>
       <li> % Processor Time is the percentage of time that the processor is executing a non-Idle thread<br>
       <li> % Interrupt Time is the percentage of time the processor spent receiving and servicing hardware interrupts during the sample interval<br>
       <li> Interrupts/sec is the average number of hardware interrupts the processor is receiving and servicing in each second<br>
       <li> Processes is the number of processes in the computer at the time of data collection<br>
       <li> Connections Established is the number of TCP connections for which the current state is either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT<br>
       <li> Segments/sec is the rate at which TCP segments are sent or received using the TCP protocol<br>
       <li> % Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of the threads of specified process used the processor to execute instructions<br>
       <li> The total number of handles currently open by specified process<br>
       <li> Current number of jobs in a print queue<br>
       <li> % Disk Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive is busy servicing read or write requests<br>
       <li> Current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected<br>
       <li> Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory available to processes running on the computer, in bytes<br>
       <li> Current Bandwidth is an estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second (BPS)<br>
       </ul><br>

      and much more...<br><br>

      <b>Condition for alert</b><br>
      KharmonMonitor can compare value of the counter with a specified number and start alert actions if the returned value is:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> less than the specified value
       <li> more than the specified value
       <li> equal to the specified number
       <li> different from the specified number
      </ul><br>

      Also KharmonMonitor has 9 alert conditions to check how new value changes compare to the previous test:<br>

      <p align=justify>
      KharmonMonitor can set status of the test to "Unknown" in case it cannot retrieve performance counter value (e.g.
       unable to connect to the remote machine or the specified counter could not be found). You can use "Treat Unknown status as Bad" option. With this option enabled, if test results cannot be obtained, actions are triggered by KharmonMonitor the same way as if the test returned a "Bad" status.<br><br>

      <b>Display mode</b><br>
      This parameter defines information display method. You can select one of 
      the following options: 
      <table border=0>
