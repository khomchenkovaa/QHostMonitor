     The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely used to synchronize computer clocks in the global Internet. Using
      NTP/SNTP test you can easily check you NTP/SNTP server.<br>
     In addition to the <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a>, the NTP test has the following options:<br><br>

     <b>Server</b><br>
     	Here you should provide the host name (e. g. <font color="#AA0000">www.yahoo.com</font>) or IP address (e. g. <font color="#AA0000">204.71.200.68</font>) 
		 of the destination host that should receive and process the request from HostMonitor. Also you may provide IPv6 addresses (e.g. <font color="#AA0000">fe80::370:ff56:fed5:22</font>) 
		 and specify hostname with suffixes <font color="#AA0000"><b>::</b>ipv4</font> or <font color="#AA0000"><b>::</b>ipv6</font> (e.g. 
		 <font color="#AA0000">www.google.com<b>::</b>ipv4</font> or <font color="#AA0000">www.6bone.net<b>::</b>ipv6</font>).<br>
		If you specify hostname without any suffix, HostMonitor will try to resolve name into IP address using IPv4 protocol. If name cannot be 
		 resolved by IPv4 protocol, HostMonitor will try to use IPv6 protocol. If you specify hostname with ::ipv4 (or ::ipv6) suffix, 
		 HostMonitor will use IPv4 (or IPv6) protocol only.<br>
		Note: on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP1 IPv6 protocol is not supported.
		<!--HostMonitor supports IPv6 on Windows XP SP2, Windows 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 when IPv6 protocol is installed. On Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 only IPv4 is supported. --> 
		 You may use menu Tools -&gt; Local Info to check is your system IPv6 ready.
		 <br><br> 
	  
     <b>Port</b><br>
     Specify the port number on which the host is listening for incoming packets. By default NTP servers using port
      #123.<br><br>

     <b>Retries</b><br>
     Set the number of times HostMonitor will resend data to the server before test fails.<br><br>

     <b>Timeout</b><br>
     Enter the amount of time (in seconds) that HostMonitor should wait for a response from the server.<br><br>

     <b>Alert when difference in time greater than XX sec</b><br>
     With this option enabled HostMonitor will mark test item as "Bad" when difference in time between the server and
      local system greater than specified value. If this option is disabled HostMonitor will set test's status to
      "Host is alive" when any correct response received from the server.<br><br>

     <b>Display mode</b><br>
     This parameter defines what HostMonitor will display in "Reply" field. Choose one of the following options:
     <ul class=list00>
      <li> Reply time  - display time required to send request and receive reply from the server
      <li> Remote time - display server's system time (Coordinated Universal Time)
      <li> Difference in time - display difference in time between server and local system
     </ul><br>
