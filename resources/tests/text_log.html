    <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">Text Log</h2>
     This test is useful when you need to check log files created by another application. Unlike "Compare Files" test that warns you when any part of a file contains some specific string the Text Log test warns you only when the string is found in a NEW record. It means that if log file already has "bad' records when you started KharmonMonitor, you will not receive any alerts; but if any new "bad" record will be added to the log file while KharmonMonitor is running, you will receive a warning about the new problem. So the Text Log test works like NT Event Log test but it checks text files instead of NT Event Log Database.<br>
     Text Log test has the following options:<br><br>

	<u>Target file</u><br><br>

     <b>File</b><br>
     Provide name (with full path specified) of the file that has to be checked. You can manually type in the filename
      that you wish to monitor, or click on the "Browse" button to select the file.<br>
     You may use wildcards in the name of the file (e.g. c:\logs\2004*.log), in this case 1st matched file will be checked.<br><br>

     If you want to perform the test using UNIX-like system, you should have in mind:
     <ul class=olist00>
      <li> use slash (/) in the path (instead of backslash (\) that you are using on Windows systems);
      <li> on UNIX-like systems name of the file is case sensitive (so "/etc/RMA" and "/etc/rma" are different files);
     </ul><br>

     <b>Translate macros</b><br>
     You may need this option if an application changes log file at regular intervals, e.g. daily or monthly. With this
      option enabled you may use special date macro variables and "User Defined Variables" in the file name (e.g. %dd% represents current day as a number with a leading zero 01..31)<br><br>

	 <b>Encoding</b><br>
	Use this option to tell KharmonMonitor what encoding is used for the file. KharmonMonitor supports several encoding methods:
	<ul class=olist0>
	 <li>ASCII
	 <li>UTF-8
	 <li>UTF-16
	 <li>UTF-16 big endian
	 <li>UTF-32
	 <li>UTF-32 big endian
	</ul>
	<p align="justify">
	Note 1 (file encoding)<br>
	 &nbsp; ASCII - each character represented by single byte; <br>
	 &nbsp; UTF-8 - variable-length character encoding for Unicode;<br>
	 &nbsp; UTF-16 - all characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane encoded by 2 bytes;<br>
	 &nbsp; UTF-32 - each Unicode character is represented by exactly 4 bytes.<br><br>

	Note 2 (Unicode support): KharmonMonitor gets information regarding current code page used on the system when you setup test item. If you check Unicode
 	 file, KharmonMonitor translates string to Unicode using stored code page.<br><br>

	Note 3 (RMA for UNIX): current version of RMA for UNIX supports ASCII encoding only. This will be improved in future version.<br><br>

	 <b>Look for</b><br>
	 <div style="padding-left: 1.5em">
      <b>string</b>: with this option selected KharmonMonitor will check records in a log file for a specified string.
          If new record contains specified data, KharmonMonitor will change status of the test to "Bad"<br><br>
      
	  <b>simple expression</b>: with this option selected KharmonMonitor will check log records using a boolean (logical)
         expression. Status of the test will be set to "Bad" when the text in the record satisfies the required conditions.
         In the expression you may use strings (must be concluded in quotes (') or double quotes (")); round brackets;
         logical operators "<font color="#AA0000">and</font>", "<font color="#AA0000">or</font>", "<font color="#AA0000">not</font>".<br>
        For example: if you define expression like <font color="#AA0000">('error' or 'warning') and not '16536'</font>,
         then KharmonMonitor will mark test as "Bad" when line in the log contains string '<font color="#AA0000">error</font>'
         or '<font color="#AA0000">warning</font>' and does not contain string '<font color="#AA0000">16536</font>'<br><br>
	  
	  <!-- 12.32 -->
	  <b>expression</b>: this mode allows to check each log record \
      
     <br>
     Options:<br>
     <b>Case sensitive</b><br>
        With this option enabled search is case sensitive<br>
     <b>Whole words only</b><br>
        Search for the whole words only. With this option disabled, the search string might be found as a part of a word.<br>
     <b>Macros</b><br>
        With this option enabled you may use "user defined" (global) and "date&amp;time"macro variables in the "look for" string/expression<br><br>

 
     <b>Warn of last new event</b><br>
     With this option enabled KharmonMonitor will scan (starting from the end of the log file) all events that were added
      into a log file since after the previous test. When the test finds a first "Bad" new record the test receives
      "Bad" status and KharmonMonitor performs specified alert action if it was specified. For example: if KharmonMonitor
      performs test every 10 minutes and 3 "Bad" events occurred within this time interval, KharmonMonitor will report
      only about the last one (because it scans starting from the end of file). This option is useful when you check
      for some specific event and don't need many messages about the same recurring error.<br><br>

     <b>Warn of all new events</b><br>
     In opposite to previous mode, with this option enabled KharmonMonitor will inform you about each event that satisfies
      specified requirements. This option is useful when you use one test item to check for different error events
      (usually you will use "Repeat: until status changes" option for appropriate alert actions).<br><br>

     <b>Display</b><br>
     Specifies what information KharmonMonitor should display in the reply field of the test item when the "bad" (or the "good") record is detected in the log file:
     <ul class=olist00>
      <li> found line
      <li> offset of the found string in the file
      <li> file size
     </ul><br>

     <b>Filter</b><br>
     When you chose "found line" mode you may apply additional filter to the select part of the line to display:
     <ul class=olist00>
      <li> display entire line
      <li> display word #N
      <li> display word #N counting from the end of line
      <li> display text from word #N1 till word #N2
      <li> display text from pos #N1 till pos #N2
     </ul><br>
	 
	<b>Words separated by</b><br>
	This option allows you to choose word separator:
     <ul class=olist00>
	  <li>space or tabs
	  <li>tabs
	  <li>comma
	  <li>semicolon	 
    </ul>
