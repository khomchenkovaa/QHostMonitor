     In KharmonMonitor you can create your own tests using different script languages such as Visual
      Basic Script or Java Script. Theoretically using this type of test you can check anything what is possible to
      check (if its impossible to retrieve some information using script language, you can create ActiveX object (e.g.
      using C++) and use this object in the script). So, you are the one who can improve KharmonMonitor to suit all your
      needs. BTW you can create your own script language<br>
     In addition to the common test parameters, the Script test has the following options:<br><br>

     <b>Run script from external file</b><br>
     Set this option and specify script file name that KharmonMonitor will load and execute every time test is performed.
      This option allows you to change script any time without changing KharmonMonitor's settings. E.g. KharmonMonitor can be
      loaded on server machine and execute scripts located on workstations.<br><br>

     <b>Store script inside HML file</b><br>
     With this option enabled KharmonMonitor will store script inside HML file with test settings. You can protect
      KharmonMonitor's settings by password and be sure nobody read or modify your scripts.<br><br>

     <b>Language</b><br>
     The Language property determines language in which a script is written. KharmonMonitor can use any script engine that
      is installed on your system. Also you can download
      and install additional script languages.<br><br>

     <b>Timeout</b><br>
     The Timeout property offers a safety shield to prevent a script program from going into an infinite loop and
      locking up the system.  It specifies the maximum number of seconds the script will run before an error will be
      generated.<br><br>

     <b>Alow UI</b><br>
     When this option enabled the script program can display user interface (UI) elements such as a MsgBox.<br><br>

     <b>Translate macros</b><br>
     With this option enabled you can use special macro variables.<br><br>

     Also Test Properties dialog contains Edit and Test buttons. First button opens Script Editor window that allows
      you to view, modify, and execute script. Test button executes script and displays result or an error message.<br><br>
