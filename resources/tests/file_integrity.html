     <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">File Integrity</h2>
KharmonMonitor can check the integrity of your files and start alert actions when changes detected. This is done by calculating the 
 CRC or MD5/SHA digest of the file and comparing it with a previously obtained value.<br>
File Integrity test offers the following options:<br><br>

<b>File</b><br>
You can manually type in the complete path and filename that you wish to monitor or click the "Browse" button to select the file.<br>
If you want to perform the test using an agent installed on UNIX-like system, you should have in mind:
<ul class="list00">
 <li>slash (/) should be used instead of backslash (\); 
 <li>on UNIX-like systems name of the file is case sensitive (so "/etc/RMA" and "/etc/rma" are different files).
</ul><br>

<b>Digest mode</b><br>
- CRC32<br>
- MD5<br>
- SHA256<br>
- SHA512<br>
Use MD5, SHA256 or SHA512 when you need to check for unauthorized file modifications (SHA256 or SHA512 is preferred).<br>
CRC32 can be used for legitimate modifications monitoring (not related to system security).<br><br>

<b>Hash</b><br>
This field shows stored digest of the file. If you changed/updated the file, you may click "Calculate" button - the program will 
 recalculate and store new digest.<br>
You may setup test item using empty Hash field. In this case KharmonMonitor will calculate and set digest on 1st test probe. This 
 saves your time when you need to setup tests for large files.<br><br>

<b>Recalculate Hash when file content changes are detected</b><br>
With this option enabled, the new checksum will be recorded every time when changes in the file are detected, so the test will return to 
 "Good" status until the checksum changes again.<br><br>
