      E-mail is commonly posted and transferred between mail servers using SMTP, but access to mail is provided through
       POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3). POP3 test can be used to test that your mail server's POP functions are
       functioning perfectly. To perform test HostMonitor login to the server and logout using specified user account.
       As an option HostMonitor can check number of messages and size of messages for specified user. If messages
       count/size exceed specified limit, the program can start alert actions.<br>
      In addition to the <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a>, the POP3 test has the following options:<br><br>

      <b>Server</b><br>
      This is the name or IP address of the mail server you want to test, usually in the form "mail.yourcom.com".<br><br>

      <b>Port</b><br>
	  The default POP3 port for unencrypted connection is 110; POP3 servers that support secured SSL connections usually accept 
	   connections using TCP port 995. If your server configured to use some non-standard port, specify port number using this property.<br><br>

	  <b>TLS</b><br>
	  This option allows you to use secured and encrypted connection (SSL). You may set "None" option to use unencrypted connection, 
	   select "Implicit" or "Explicit" to use encrypted connection. Supported SSL protocols: TLS1, SSL3, SSL2 and PCT1.<br>
	  Additional SSL options located on <a href="options.htm#miscSSL1">Misc</a> page in the <a href="options.htm">Options</a> dialog.<br><br>	  
	  
      <b>Timeout</b><br>
      This is the amount of time in seconds the program will wait for a response from the server before the request fails.
       Set this to 0 for no timeout (not recommended).<br><br>

      <b>User Name</b><br>
      HostMonitor will test the POP server by logging in to it using an existing account. In the user name field, supply
       the name of an account that can be used for testing. HostMonitor will log into the account and check the status
       of its mailbox without accessing, modifying or deleting any of the messages held in it.<br><br>

      <b>Password</b><br>
      Supply the password for the user account HostMonitor will log into during the test.<br><br>

      <b>Alert when mailbox contains more then [NN] messages</b><br>
      Mark this option and specify limit amount of messages in a mailbox. When this limit is reached, HostMonitor will
       change test status to Bad.<br><br>

      <b>Alert when total size of messages bigger than [NN] MB</b><br>
      Mark this option and specify the size limit of all messages in a mailbox. When this limit is reached, HostMonitor
       will change test status to Bad.<br><br>

      Note: Value of the 'Reply' field depends on the test's settings:<br>
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> if test checks number of messages, HostMonitor will display number of messages
       <li> if test checks total size of messages, HostMonitor will display total size of messages.
       <li> if both these options disabled and test checks server status only (connect, login and logout), Reply value will contain the test execution time (that shows the reply speed of the server).
       <li> Reply value is empty when the program cannot connect or login to server
     </ul><br>
