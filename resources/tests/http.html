         The HTTP test provides you with the ability to monitor HTTP based servers, verify the content of dynamically generated pages, check for the changed content. Also it can help you verify that CGI scripts and back-end databases are functioning properly.
      In contrast to URL test, that can perform HTTP request as well, HTTP test does not use wininet.dll (part of Internet Explorer). In this way we can avoid any problems related to IE's bugs (of course we can make mistakes as well but we always are able to fix our own mistakes :-).
      Also using HTTP test you can define more parameters specific to HTTP protocol and setup more varied checks.<br>
     HTTP test has the following options:<br><br>

     <b>URL</b><br>
     Enter the URL you want to monitor (for example, http://www.ourbiggestserver.com)<br><br>

     <b><a name="httpproxy">Proxy</a></b><br>
     Optionally, a proxy server can be used to access the URL. Select a proxy server from the drop down list or choose "<font color="#AA0000">&lt;none&gt;</font>" to perform direct request to HTTP server.<br>
     You can open Proxies List dialog to modify the list of proxy servers. For each item from the proxy list you can specify:
     <ul class=list00>
      <li> Domain name or IP address of the HTTP proxy server
      <li> TCP port
      <li> User name
      <li> Password
     </ul>

     <p align=justify>
     <b>Request</b><br>
     Choose type of HTTP request:<br>
     <table border=0>
      <tr><td valign=top nowrap><b>HEADER</b>&nbsp; </td><td><p align=justify> request for HTTP header. Server will return status information about the document (HTTP header) but will not transfer data. It allows you to check web server functionality with minimum network traffic but you cannot check the content of the web page.</td></tr>
      <tr><td valign=top nowrap><b>GET   </b>&nbsp; </td><td><p align=justify>
         request the page specified by URL parameter. Server will return status information (HTTP header) and data.
         You can use "Check content" and "Check CRC" options to monitor contents of the page.</td></tr>
      <tr><td valign=top nowrap><b>POST  </b>&nbsp; </td><td><p align=justify>
         send data (defined in "Post data" field) to the web server to be processed in some way, like by a CGI script. In this case URL is not a resource to retrieve; it's usually a program to handle the data you are sending. The HTTP response is normally the program output, not a static file. The most common use of POST is to submit HTML form data to CGI scripts. In this case, the "<font color="#AA0000">Content-Type:</font>" header is usually set to "<font color="#AA0000">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</font>". So, when you choose POST request, KharmonMonitor adds this header into "Optional headers" field by default. However you can change that header to another one or remove it.</td></tr>

     <b>Follow redirect</b><br>
     This parameter determines the KharmonMonitor's behavior, when the server issues a redirect. When the option enabled
      KharmonMonitor follows redirect and retrieve URL specified by server. If option disabled and HTTP server returns code
      301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Moved Temporarily), KharmonMonitor marks test as "Bad".<br><br>

     <b>Post data</b><br>
     If the URL is for a POST request, enter the post variables as <font color="#AA0000">name1=value1&amp;name2=value2</font>.
      This option is used to verify that a form is working correctly by performing the same request which occurs when
      a user submits a form.<br><br>

     <b>Authorization</b><br>
     Use this option when the URL specified requires a name and password for access.<br>
     <b>User name</b><br>
     If the URL specified requires a name and password for access, enter the user name in this box.<br>
     <b>Password</b><br>
     If the URL specified requires a name and password for access, enter the password in this box.<br>
     KharmonMonitor supports basic and NTLM authentication methods.<br><br>

     <b>Agent</b><br>
     Some server-based scripts can check agent's name and return different information for different HTTP agents
      (e.g. generate different HTML pages for Internet Explorer or Netscape). You can change this parameter to get
      correct results.<br><br>

     <b>Timeout</b><br>
     Specify the number of seconds that the test should wait for a page to complete downloading before timing-out.
      Once this time period is over, the monitor will mark test as "No answer". If you have checked the "Download
      nested frames" or "Download images" option, KharmonMonitor will use the same timeout for all frames/images
      referenced on the page.<br>
     If the Timeout property is set to 0 (default value), KharmonMonitor will use default Windows timeout specified for
      TCP protocol.<br><br>

     <b>Allow per-session cookies</b><br>
     With this option enabled KharmonMonitor remembers cookies received from the server, and sends them back in case of
      redirection to another URL.<br>
     This option can be useful when you need to check some access-restricted resources. Often web-based authorization
      systems use cookies to identify user. How it usually works:<br>
     - user opens login page, enters login and password, and clicks "Login" button;<br>
     - browser sends POST or GET request to a server with data entered by user;<br>
     - server checks login/password and (in case data are correct) assings session ID for the  user;<br>
     - server sends cookie that contains ID to user's browser, and redirects user to another page;<br>
     - browser must store cookie and send it back to server every time it (browser) requests access-restricted pages<br>
     So, now KharmonMonitor can work like your browser and login to your mailbox to check whether you have the new messages.<br><br>

     <b><a name="httpoptheaders">Optional headers</a></b><br>
     Specify optional HTTP headers those will be added to request. For example you can define cookies using string like
      "<font color="#AA0000">Cookie: name1=value1; name2=value2; name3=value3</font>". When you send data to the server
      using POST method, KharmonMonitor automatically insert "<font color="#AA0000">Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</font>"       header.
