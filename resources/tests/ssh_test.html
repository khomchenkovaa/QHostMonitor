    <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">SSH</h2>
	Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices. Used primarily on UNIX based systems to access shell accounts, SSH was designed as a replacement for TELNET and other insecure remote shells.<br>
	SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands. The encryption used by SSH provides confidentiality and integrity of data over an insecure network, such as the Internet.<br><br>

	KharmonMonitor can connect and login to specified remote system running the SSH daemon and execute a command or shell script. 
	KharmonMonitor may perform SSH test directly or using RMA for Windows.<br><br>

	SSH test has the following options:<br><br>

	<b>Host</b><br>
	Host name or IP address of the system that provides SSH service<br><br>

	<b>Port</b><br>
	Specify TCP port used by SSH server (SSH server, by default, listens on TCP port 22)<br><br>

	<b>Timeout</b><br>
	Specify timeout in miliseconds<br><br>

	<b>Command</b><br>
	Specify command line that should be executed on target server<br><br>
	
	<b>Translate date macros</b><br>
	With this option enabled you may use special date macro variables in the command line<br><br>

	<b>Check for</b><br>
	SSH test allows you to check result of the command execution in 3 different ways:<br>
	<ul>
	 <li><b>Check for exit code</b><br>
	     In such case KharmonMonitor checks errorlevel returned by the command. You should choose one of the following conditions:<br>
		 Alert if exit code
		<table border=0>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b> &nbsp; is &lt; than </b> </td><td nowrap valign=top> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is less than a specified code.</td></tr>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b> &nbsp; is &gt; than </b> </td><td nowrap valign=top> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is greater than a specified code.</td></tr>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b> &nbsp; is = to   </b> </td><td nowrap valign=top> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is equal to a specified code.    </td></tr>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b> &nbsp; is &lt;&gt; from</b> </td><td nowrap valign=top> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is different than a specified code.</td></tr>
		</table><br>
	 <li><b>Check for text output</b><br>
		 KharmonMonitor can search for a string in the command output and start alert actions when the string exists (or doesn't exist). 
		  You should specify a string and condition to alert using the following options:<br>
		Alert if
		<table border=0>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b>&nbsp; string present</b></td><td> KharmonMonitor will set "Bad" status when output contains specified string </td></tr>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b>&nbsp; string absent </b></td><td> KharmonMonitor will set "Bad contents" status when output does not contain specified string </td></tr>
		 <tr><td nowrap valign=top><b>&nbsp; expression true &nbsp;&nbsp;</b> </td><td><p align=justify> KharmonMonitor will consider provided text as boolean (logical) expression, evaluate this expression 
		    using data received from the server, and set "Bad" status when retrieved data does not satisfy the required conditions.<br>
		   For example: if you define expression like "<font color="#AA0000">'No errors' and not ('Error' or 'Warning')</font>", then 
		   KharmonMonitor will mark test as "Ok" when command output contains string '<font color="#AA0000">No error</font>' and does not contain 
		   either '<font color="#AA0000">Error</font>' or '<font color="#AA0000">Warning</font>'<br>
		   In the expression you may use strings (must be put in quotes (') or in double quotes (")); round brackets; logical operators 
		    "and", "or", "not".</td></tr>
		</table> 
		Additional options:<br>
		<b>Case sensitive</b><br>
		With this option enabled search is case sensitive<br>
		<b>Whole words only</b><br>
		Searches are for words only. With this option disabled, the search string might be found within longer words.<br>
		<b>Macros</b><br>
		This option allows you to use date macro variables in the search string. E.g. if you provide 
		 "<font color="#AA0000">%mm%-%dd%-%yyyyy%</font>" in the search string, KharmonMonitor will check retrieved data for the presence of a current date and will set 
		 "Bad" status for output without current date stamp.<br><br>

	 <li><b>Check for Shell Script result</b><br>
		KharmonMonitor checks output text for specially formatted result string. I.e. result of the command execution should follow 
		 the same rules as Shell Script<br><br>
	</ul>
	
	<p align=justify>
	Note 1: KharmonMonitor supports 3DES, AES128-ctr, AES192-ctr, AES256-ctr, AES128-cbc, AES192-cbc, AES256-cbc and Blowfish encryption methods 
	 for SSHv2. If you are using old SSHv1 server, KharmonMonitor will use 3DES encryption only.<br><br>
	Note 2: Since SSH-1 has inherent design flaws which make it vulnerable (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks), it is now generally considered 
	 obsolete and should be avoided.<br><br>
