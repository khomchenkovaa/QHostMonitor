## KharmonMonitor
Qt clone of HostMonitor for Linux

**KharmonMonitor** is a network monitor program. You can create a list of jobs and tests in advance on a "set and forget" basis. Among the many checks it can do, it can monitor any TCP service, ping a host, retrieve an URL, check the available disk space, check integrity of your files and web site, test your SQL servers, check SMTP/POP/IMAP/DNS/LDAP servers, monitor CPU Usage, and much more.

**KharmonMonitor** checks network servers at regular intervals and takes pre-defined actions if a device does not respond. It can provide a visual and sound warning, send an E-mail message to a mailbox, pager or mobile phone, execute external programs, restart NT services, reboot local or remote computers, dial-up to the network, etc. All these actions allow you to respond to a problem before your users start to complain.

**KharmonMonitor** can generate test result log files and reports. **KharmonMonitor** provides different log file detail levels and log file formats and can be configured to suit your needs. The highly flexible Report Manager allows you to create and customize reports to your liking in a variety of ways.

**KharmonMonitor** provides system administrators with the benefits of a powerful network monitor. **KharmonMonitor** is a network administrator's vigilant assistant. Administrative overhead is reduced as the administrator doesn't need to check servers manually. Network administrator downtime is reduced and user satisfaction improved by the prompt response to server failures.
