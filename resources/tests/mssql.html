      KharmonMonitor can test your SQL servers. It supports MS SQL servers.<br>
	  Servers are checked by logging into (and out) of the server. You should specify the server name, database, user name and password.<br><br>

      In order to monitor MS SQL servers KharmonMonitor uses the MS SQL Call Interface (ntwdblib.dll), you should have the MS SQL client software installed on the computer.<br>
      
      	 <a name="db_bugs1"><br></a>
		<b>MS SQL notes</b>: ntwdblib.dll does not allow connection to modern MS SQL servers using Windows Authentication; only 
		 SQL Server Authentication can be used (the user name and the password are created by using SQL Server and stored in SQL Server; 
		 not based on Windows user accounts). If you need Windows Authentication, then you may use "ODBC Query" test method instead.<br><br>	  
       		
		MS SQL test methods may display "unknown" status and appropriate error message in the Reply field when it was impossible to perform the check (e.g. when client library is not installed).
