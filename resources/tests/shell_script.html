     Shell Script method combines the versatility of "External" and convenience of "Active Script" method.
     Both "External" and "Shell Script" test methods execute specified commands as new processes. Due to this nature it is possible to use any programming tool for test creation. E.g. you may use Visual Basic script, Java script, create real executable file using C++ compiler or use simple BAT file or shell script.
     On the other hand this test method allows passing of any valid Status and Reply values back to KharmonMonitor. Just like "Active Script" (formerly "Script") test method.<br>
     Shell Script test has the following options:<br><br>

     <b>Script</b><br>
     Choose script profile from drop down list box or click "Script Manager" button to view/modify/select the script.
      "Script Manager" allows you to view and modify scripts; check script comments, version and
      history; import and export existing scripts; create and test new scripts.<br><br>

     <b>Params</b><br>
     If script requires some parameters, "Hint" field will show you the list of parameters. E.g. "SYSTEM: Average Load
      for the past 5 min" script requires single parameter: &lt;alert threshold&gt;. If you specify "50" as the script
      parameter and script detects that system load is over 50%, it will set "Bad" status for the test. Otherwise
      status of the test will be "Ok".<br><br>

     <b>Timeout</b><br>
     The Timeout property offers a safety shield to prevent a script program from going into an infinite loop and
      locking up the system.  It specifies the maximum number of seconds the script can run before KharmonMonitor (or RMA)
      terminates the script and sets "Unknown" status for the test.<br>
     If you set Timeout to 0, KharmonMonitor will not terminate script.<br><br>

	 
<!--==== Script manager ======-->

     <a name="shellmng"><font color="#CC0000"><b>Script Manager</b></font></a><br>
     You may reach Script Manager dialog from the Test Properties dialog (as described above) or use main window menu
      "Test"-&gt;"New"-&gt;"Shell Script test"-&gt;"Script Manager"<br><br>

     <b>New</b><br>
     Creates new profile.<br><br>

     <b>Copy</b><br>
     Makes a copy of the selected profile. You will need to change either the name of profile or the target platform.
      KharmonMonitor does not allow having several scripts with the same name for the same target platform. However you
      may have several scripts with the same name for different platforms (e.g. "CPU Usage" script for Linux, "CPU
      Usage" script for Solaris and "CPU Usage" script for Windows).<br><br>

     <b>Delete</b><br>
     Removes selected profile. Tests that were using deleted profile will not function properly after profile deletion
      and will return "Unknown" status.<br><br>

     <b>Revoke</b><br>
     Revokes changes that were made in selected profile. To cancel all changes that were made in the list of profiles
      use Cancel button instead.<br><br>

    <b>Usage report</b><br>
	This option shows usage report for selected script. It tells you where script is used.<br><br>

     <br>
     You may sort script profiles in different orders. Menu items for the appropriate test methods will be arranged in
     the same order (menu items that located in the menu Test->New->Shell Script and in the pop-up menu Add->Shell
     Script).<br><br>

     <b>Sort by name</b><br>
     Allows you to sort profiles by name in alphabetical order.<br>
     <b>Sort by platform</b><br>
     Groups profiles by target platform, sorts profiles alphabetically within each group.<br><br>
 
     <br>
     <a name="shellimport"><b>Import</b></a><br>
     Brings up "Import" dialog window that allows you to select file with script profiles, view profiles, select some
      of them and import into current list.<br><br>

     To avoid accidental script replacement a dialog shows the status of scripts (new, newer, exists, older) and uses different icons for the scripts.<br>
     Script statuses have the following meanings:
     <table border=0>
      <tr><td nowrap valign=top><ul class=list00><li>new    </ul></td><td><p align=justify> Script that is going to be imported does not exist in the current list. It is marked by green icon that means you can import script without any fear of losing existing settings.</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap valign=top><ul class=list00><li>newer&nbsp; </ul></td><td><p align=justify> Script that is going to be imported already exists in the list, however it has more recent modification date and higher version number than existing script. Marked by yellow, probably you should check the list of modifications that has been made to this script.</td></tr>
     </table><table border=0>
      <tr><td nowrap valign=top><ul class=list00><li>exists&nbsp;</ul></td><td><p align=justify> Script already exists in the list; it has the same modification date and version number. Marked by grey.</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap valign=top><ul class=list00><li>older  </ul></td><td><p align=justify> Script that is going to be imported already exists in the list, however it has older modification date and lower version number than existing one. Marked by red - risk of  losing some functionality if you import this script</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap valign=top><ul class=list00><li>??     </ul></td><td><p align=justify> Script that is going to be imported already exists in the list. KharmonMonitor is confused because script's modification date and version number are not correlating (e.g. "import" script has more recent modification date than current script but has lower version than current script. Or vice versa.)</td></tr>
     </table>
     If you click "Import" button and some of the current scripts are going to be replaced, KharmonMonitor will ask for
      confirmation.<br>
     By the way: you may select another file for importing without closing the dialog. Use "Import file" control for
      this purpose.<br><br>

     <br>
     <b>Export</b><br>
     This function brings up "Export" dialog that allows you to select some (or all) scripts from the current list
      and export them into specified file. So, you may send this file to your colleague.<br><br>

    <u>General script information</u><br><br>

    <b>Name</b><br>
    Provide the name of the script. This name will be displayed in drop down list in the Test Properties dialog, also
     KharmonMonitor will create menu item (with the same title) in "Shell Script" submenu. If you click on that item,
     KharmonMonitor will create new test with preselected script.<br>
    Please note KharmonMonitor does not allow you to have several scripts with the same name for the same target platform.
     However you may have several scripts with the same name for different platforms (e.g. "CPU Usage" script for Linux,
     "CPU Usage" script for Solaris and "CPU Usage" script for Windows).<br><br>

    <b>Hint</b><br>
    List of script parameters (if any). This parameter is optional however we recommend to use it. It will be displayed
     in the Test Properties dialog as a reminder - which parameters should be specified for the script. E.g. "Process:
     %CPU usage (average)" script has 2 parameters: &lt;process_name&gt; and &lt;maximum threshold (%)&gt;<br><br>

    <b>Developer</b><br>
    Select name of the developer from drop down list. If your name is not in the list yet, just type the name and
     KharmonMonitor adds it to the list.<br><br>

    <b>Platform</b><br>
    Choose the platform on which a script can be executed. E.g. Windows, Linux, or UNIX (if script can be executed on
     any UNIX-like system). If the script can be executed on several platforms (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD), please
     separate platforms by slash (e.g. FreeBSD/Linux).<br><br>

    <b>Version</b><br>
    Script version. Import manager uses information about version and modification date (see <a href="#shellimport">above</a>).
     If you change script that was developed by somebody else, please, change version number.<br><br>

    <b>Date</b><br>
    Date of the last modification. KharmonMonitor updates this field automatically when you modify the script.
     Import manager uses information about version and modification date (see <a href="#shellimport">above</a>).<br><br>

    <!--========================-->
    <a name="createshell_comment"><br></a>
    <u>Optional fields</u><br><br>

    <b>Comment</b><br>
    Any comment that makes sense for you and could be helpful for yourself or other administrators. It is useful to
     describe the purpose of the script, version of the operating system(s) where script was tested, list of parameters,
     or other essential information.<br><br>

    <b>History</b><br>
    If you made changes to some script developed by Advanced Network Software (KS-Soft) or somebody else, please, make report about this
     modification in History section. If you modify your own script, this section can be useful as well. Please
     provide the date of the modification, version number, who made the changes, comments about modification
     (KharmonMonitor adds date and version number automatically, however you may change it).<br><br>

    <!--========================-->
    <a name="createshell_cmd"><br><u>Script section</u></a><br><br>

    This is the most important section; here you define the script and the command that KharmonMonitor/RMA will use to
     start the script.
