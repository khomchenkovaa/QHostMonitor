    <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">WMI</h2>
    <b>WMI</b> is an acronym for <b>W</b>indows <b>M</b>anagement <b>I</b>nstrumentation. WMI is the Microsoft's implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) - a new management technology that allows software to monitor and control managed resources throughout the network. Such managed resources include hard drives, file systems, settings of operating system, processes, services, shares, registry settings, networking components, event logs, users, groups, etc.<br>
    WMI allows monitoring of performance counters as well. Microsoft applications such as Exchange and SQL Server have WMI built-in. Many non-Microsoft applications utilize WMI and thus they could be monitored using Advanced Host Monitor as well.<br><br>
    WMI test has the following options:<br>
	<p align=justify>
	
	<b>Host</b><br>
	Provide the host name (e.g. <font color="#AA0000">mainserver</font>) or IP address (e.g. <font color="#AA0000">192.168.1.55</font>) 
 	 of the host that you wish to monitor.<br><br>

	<b>Authentication Level</b><br>
	This option is necessary for access to some namespaces. E.g. <font color="#AA0000">root\cimv2\TerminalServices</font> namespace 
	 requires Packet Privacy authentication level.<br><br>
	 
	<b>Name space</b><br>
	WMI namespace is a container grouping child objects related to one another in some way. A namespace contains 
	 a hierarchy of classes and associations, which define either a machine's object or the relationship between 
	 two or more objects. The most commonly used namespace is CIMV2 (root\cimv2) - Common Information Model 
	 Version 2.<br><br>

	<b>Query</b><br>
	Provide WQL (WMI Query Language) query. This query will be performed at test execution time and result data 
	 set will be checked by KharmonMonitor.<br>
	Examples:
	<ol class=olist0>
	 <li style="text-align: justify">If you want to monitor the number of handles used by all running instances of the 
	  Internet Explorer, use the query like this: <font color="#AA0000">SELECT HandleCount FROM Win32_Process WHERE name='iexplore.exe'</font>
	 <li style="text-align: justify">If you need to monitor the number of processes which use more than 10 threads,
 	  use the following query: <font color="#AA0000">SELECT ThreadCount FROM Win32_Process WHERE ThreadCount&gt;10</font>
	 <li style="text-align: justify">The query: <font color="#AA0000">SELECT Name FROM Win32_Service WHERE 
	  Started=0 AND StartMode='Auto'</font> shows all services which have not started and have the start mode 
	  configured to "Automatic". 
	</ol>
	<p align=justify>
	You may click the right mouse button on the test item and choose "Explore WMI" item from the popup menu. 
	 When you do so, KharmonMonitor will start "WMI Explorer" in the Query mode, passing the query and information about the target host (such as the hostname, name space, login, etc) to the explorer. This allows you to check quickly hardware and software parameters on the target system and instantly see what is going on (e.g. why the test item has been failed).<br><br>
	 
    <b>Alert if</b><br>
	This option specifies when exactly test result(s) should be considered as "bad" and appropriate alert actions 
	 should be started. There are 3 parameters should be provided: aggregation mode, compare mode and compare 
	 value.
	<ol> 
	<li><a name="wmitestaggregation">Aggregation mode</a><br>
	  Specifies how KharmonMonitor should compare result data when WML query returns several rows. Choose one of the 
	  following option:<br>
	  <b>Any</b><br>
		Tell KharmonMonitor to compare data from EVERY row. If ANY row matches specified compare condition, 
		KharmonMonitor will set "Bad" test status.<br>
	  <b>Average</b><br>
		Tells KharmonMonitor to calculate average value of the rows and compare average to the specified number.<br>
	  <b>Total</b><br>
		Tells KharmonMonitor to calculate sum of the rows and then compare total to the specified number.<br>
	  <b>Row count</b><br>
		Tell KharmonMonitor to calculate row count and compare number of rows to the specified number<br><br>
