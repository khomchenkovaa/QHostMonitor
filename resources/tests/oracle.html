      KharmonMonitor can test your SQL servers.
	  Servers are checked by logging into (and out) of the server. You should specify the server name (the TNS alias for Oracle), 
	  database, user name and password.<br><br>
      
      In order to monitor Oracle servers KharmonMonitor uses the Oracle Call Interface (oci.dll), you should have the Oracle client software installed on the computer.<br>
