     The DHCP test allows you to monitor DHCP servers. HostMonitor verifies the DHCP server by sending request 
	  for IP address. HostMonitor sets "Host is alive" status when DHCP server properly responds within specified 
	  timeout, whatever it replies with NAK or ACK packet. Otherwise HostMonitor may set "Bad"
	  (invalid reply from server) or "No answer" status.<br>
	 In addition to the <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a>, the DHCP test has the following options:<br><br>

    <b>Host</b><br>
	This is the domain name or IP address of the machine running the DHCP server that you wish to monitor.<br><br>

    <b>Timeout</b><br>
	This is the amount of time in milliseconds the program will wait for a response from the server before the request fails.<br><br>

    <b>Request IP</b><br>
	Here you may specify IP address that will be requested or keep default value &lt;current local IP&gt;<br><br>
