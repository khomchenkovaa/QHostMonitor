  <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">Disk free space</h2>
	This test may check several drives on target system and find the drive with minimum free space or the drive with minimal percentage of free space. 
	 This version of Drive Free Space test method checks systems using SNMP requests, this allows to check non-shared resources on remote Windows or UNIX systems.<br><br>
    Drive Free Space test has the following options:<br><br>

	  <b>Target host</b><br>
	 Provide host name, IPv6  or IPv4 address (e.g. <span class="samplered">10.10.1.55</span>) of the system that you wish to monitor.<br>
	 Optionally you may specify UDP port; port number has to be provided after a colon following the address(hostname)
	 (e.g. <span class="samplered">172.168.10.10<b>:161</b></span>).<br><br>
	   
    <b>SNMP profile</b><br>
	 Choose profile that stores credentials necessary for communication with SNMP agent on target system. You may select profile 
	  from drop-down list or click button beside the list to bring up SNMP Credentials dialog.<br>
	 Note: KharmonMonitor may retrieve data faster when SNMP v2c or SNMP v3 is used.<br><br>
	 
     <b>Timeout, Retries</b><br>
     Timeout - the amount of time in milliseconds the program will wait for a response from the server before the request fails.<br>
	 Retries - specifies the communications retry count.<br>
	 You may specify timeout and retries value in text field, type integer numbers separating values by space or colon or semicolon like 
	  "2000ms, 1" or "300,1" or "500 1"; also you may open "Connection parameters" window and choose Port, Timeout, Retries<br><br>
	  
	  Then you may select one or several of the following options
	  <table border="0">
	   <tbody><tr valign="top"><td nowrap=""><b>- Check all local drives</b></td><td>tells KharmonMonitor to check all fixed drives on target system</td></tr>
	   <tr valign="top"><td nowrap=""><b>- Check all removable drives</b>&nbsp;</td><td>check all removable drives on target system (not including CD/DVD drives)</td></tr>
	   <tr valign="top"><td nowrap=""><b>- Check listed drive(s)</b> </td><td>mark this option and provide drive list when you want to check specific 
	     drive(s) on target system, e.g. <span class="samplered">C: D: E: M:</span> or <span class="samplered">/var /dev/sda/</span>.
		 Note: wildcard * can be used at the end of disk name, e.g. /dev/sd*</td></tr>
	  </tbody></table><br>
	  
	  <b>Alert if free space less than &lt;N&gt; MB/GB/TB/%</b><br>
	  When KharmonMonitor checks several drives it finds drive with smallest amount of free space (or drive with minimal percentage of free space 
	   when "%" alert options is selected) and sets Ok or Bad test status depending on amount of free space and value of this option.<br>
	  Also %DiskID% and %DiskLabel% variables can be used as parameters of the actions, providing information about target drive.<br><br>
