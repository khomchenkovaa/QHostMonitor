     KharmonMonitor has many built-in check types, but it can not support all possible
     check types. That's why the program contains an External Test. With the
     External Test, KharmonMonitor uses an external application to perform a test
     and, based on the returned errorlevel, will flag the test entry as being
     up or down. <br>
     The External test has the following options:<br><br>

     <b>External program</b><br>
     Specify command line to launch external application<br><br>

     <b>Condition</b><br>
     Choose condition to mark test as failed (and start alert action):
     <table border="0">
      <tbody><tr><td nowrap="" valign="top"><b> &nbsp; is &lt; than </b> </td><td nowrap="" valign="top"> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is less than a specified code.</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="" valign="top"><b> &nbsp; is &gt; than </b> </td><td nowrap="" valign="top"> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is greater than a specified code.</td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="" valign="top"><b> &nbsp; is = to   </b> </td><td nowrap="" valign="top"> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is equal to a specified code.    </td></tr>
      <tr><td nowrap="" valign="top"><b> &nbsp; is &lt;&gt; from</b> </td><td nowrap="" valign="top"> &nbsp; - </td><td>alert if the errorlevel returned by the program is different than a specified code.</td></tr>
     </tbody></table><br>

     <b>Kill application if no answer within N sec</b><br>
     You may select the "Kill application after N sec" option and specify a timeout.
     In this case if the external application hasn't returned an error level
     to KharmonMonitor within the given timeout, KharmonMonitor will flag the test
     entry as down and "kill" the external application.<br><br><br>
