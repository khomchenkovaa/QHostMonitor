    <td class=tdjust>
      The DNS test acts as a low-level resolver and connects directly to the target name server to perform a query.
       This means that the test is completely independent of the host files, DNR cache, etc.<br><br>

       DNS test has the following options:<br><br>

      <b>Server</b><br>
     	Here you should provide the domain name (e. g. <font color="#AA0000">DNS1.IU.EDU</font>) or IP address (e. g. <font color="#AA0000">204.71.200.68</font>) 
		 of the machine running the DNS server that you wish to monitor. Using a domain name in the "Server" field requires that the domain name 
		 be resolved before the Domain Name Server can be tested, creating ambiguity in testing. It is better to enter the IP address of your 
		 Domain Name Server, as opposed to the domain name, so that the test will always report the correct error if the DNS fails.<br>
		 Also you may provide IPv6 addresses (e.g. <font color="#AA0000">fe80::370:ff56:fed5:22</font>) 
		 and specify hostname with suffixes <font color="#AA0000"><b>::</b>ipv4</font> or <font color="#AA0000"><b>::</b>ipv6</font> (e.g. 
		 <font color="#AA0000">DNS1.IU.EDU<b>::</b>ipv4</font> or <font color="#AA0000">NS-AOA.ES.NET<b>::</b>ipv6</font>).<br>
		If you specify hostname without any suffix, KharmonMonitor will try to resolve name into IP address using IPv4 protocol. If name cannot be 
		 resolved by IPv4 protocol, KharmonMonitor will try to use IPv6 protocol. If you specify hostname with ::ipv4 (or ::ipv6) suffix, 
		 KharmonMonitor will use IPv4 (or IPv6) protocol only.<br><br> 
	   
      <b>Protocol</b><br>
      Select the protocol to use: TCP or UDP<br><br>

      <b>Port</b><br>
      The default test port is 53, but you can specify a non-standard port. For a list of conventional port numbers
       click the button to the right of the port number box.<br><br>

      <b>Timeout</b><br>
      This is the amount of time in seconds the program will wait for a response from the server before the request
       fails.<br><br>

      <b>Request / Request type</b><br>
	  Use these options to specify the domain name that should be requested from DNS server and type of the request.
	  You may choose one of the following requests:
	  <ul class=list00>
		<li>A type request - request for IPv4 (IP version 4) address of the host
		<li>AAAA request - request for IPv6 (IP version 6) address of the host
		<li>CNAME - canonical name request
		<li>NS - authoritative server request
		<li>MX - mail routing information requests
		<li>PTR - reverse DNS
		<li>TXT - text records
		<li>SPF - Sender Policy Framework records	
	  </ul>
	  Note: you may specify protocol used for communication (IPv4 or IPv6) and type of the request (A or AAAA) completely independently. E.g. 
	   KharmonMonitor may connect to DNS server <font color="#AA0000">204.71.200.68</font> using IPv4 protocol and retrieve AAAA (IPv6) record or 
	   it may send request to host <font color="#AA0000">fe80::370:ff56:fed5:22</font> using IPv6 protocol and retrieve A (IPv4) record.<br>
	  <br>

      <b>Test result for</b><br>
	  If you are using "A" type request, you can define the IP address that will be compared with the address 
	   returned from the DNS server being tested. You can use "Test" button to have KharmonMonitor fill in this 
	   field, or you can enter the expected IP address yourself.<br>
	  Similarly you may check results of CNAME, NS, MX, TXT and SPF requests.<br><br>
