    <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">NT Event Log</h2>
       Event logging in Microsoft Windows provides a standard, centralized way for applications (and the operating system) to record important software and hardware events. The event-logging service stores events from various sources in a single collection called an event log. KharmonMonitor can check this log and start alert actions if some specific events occur.<br>
       NT Event Log test has the following options:<br><br>

	   <b>Compatibility</b><br>
		For each test item you may choose "Windows NT API" or "Windows Vista+ API" mode. If KharmonMonitor is started on Windows Vista, 
		 Windows 7/8/10 or Windows Server 2008/2012/2016 and target host uses one of these operational systems as well, we recommend using "Windows Vista API" mode. 
		Otherwise you should use "Windows NT API" mode that works fine for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 as well.<br>
		Note: if you switch mode for existing test, KharmonMonitor will consider such modified test as new item and ignore "old" events.<br><br>
	   
       <b>Computer</b><br>
       The Universal Naming Convention (UNC) name of the server on which the event log is to be opened (the target
        computer name must be prefixed by "\\"). Type the UNC or select the "&lt;local computer&gt;" item, also you
        can use the "Browse network" button to select a computer from the list.<br><br>

       <b>Event Log (Channel)</b><br>
		Provide name of the event log that will be checked by KharmonMonitor. This can be the Application, Security, or System log, or a custom registered log.<br>
		Note: "Log" vs. "Channel"<br>
		Starting from Windows Vista, events use the concept of "event channels" instead of "event logs" used for downlevel platforms. From 
		 KharmonMonitor's "poing of view" channels and logs are interchangeable.  The Windows Vista/2008 backwards compatibility logs are named
		 the same as they were on downlevel platforms (Application, Security, etc).<br>
		The only tricky thing to note about the channels in Vista/Server 2008 is that the folder structure in the Windows Event Viewer 
		 application does not necessarily match correct channel name (Windows Event Viewer changes channel names to present them in nicer form).<br><br>
		
       <b>Event Source (Publisher)</b><br>
       Select the source of events (application, service, driver, subsystem). If you leave this field blank, KharmonMonitor
        will check events from all sources.<br>
		Also you may specify event source using * as wildcard at the end of the string. E.g. if you type "MsExchange*", KharmonMonitor will 
		 check for events produced by "MsExchangeIS", "MSExhange ActiveSync", "MSExchange ADAccess", etc<br><br>

	   <b>Connect as</b><br>
       To check an Event Log on the remote system you can mark this option and provide a username and a password for a
        connection to the target computer.<br><br><br>

		<u>Alert conditions:</u><br><br>
		
		When you setup test item using Event Log Test Properties dialog, you should provide filters (one or more conditions) that will separate "Bad" and "Good" events. Event passes the filter only when 
		 it matches ALL specified requirements of the filter.<br><br>

		When KharmonMonitor finds new message that fits "Bad" filter conditions, it changes status of the test item to "Bad".
