      KharmonMonitor can test your SQL servers. It supports Interbase MySQL servers.<br> 
	  Servers are checked by logging into (and out) of the server. You should specify the server name, database, user name and password.<br><br>

      In order to monitor MySQL servers KharmonMonitor uses the MySQL Call Interface (libmysql.dll), you should have the MySQL client software installed on the computer.<br>

		<b>MySQL v8 notes</b>: libmySQL.dll from MySQL Connector v8 is not supported yet; libmySQL.dll version 5.x can be used for connection 
	    to MySQL v8 but in this case you have to create a user account using mysql_native_password plugin (because default MySQL v8 
		caching_sha2_password authentication is not supported by MySQL 5.x).<br>
       <b>MySQL known problems</b>: MySQL Connectors prior version 5.26 have bugs and may cause KharmonMonitor to crash. You may download 
	    stable version of MySQL library or at least place all MySQL test items into one folder and use "Non-simultaneously test execution" folder-specific option.<br><br>
		
		MS SQL test methods may display "unknown" status and appropriate error message in the Reply field when it was impossible to perform the check (e.g. when client library is not installed).
