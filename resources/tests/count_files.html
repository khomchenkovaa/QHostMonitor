      This test allows you to check number of files in the specified directory. Let`s say you have a mailserver that
       uses a spool directory. If the mail server is running correctly, it should deliver the mail within 5 minutes to
       the internet. Using Count Files test HostMonitor can check the number of files in the mail server`s spool
       directory and warn you when number of files exceed specified limit.<br>
      In addition to the <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a>, the Count Files test has the following options:<br><br>

      <b>Folder</b><br>
      Specify the directory in what you want to count the amount of files.<br><br>

      <b>File name mask</b><br>
      Specify file name mask. Usually mask contains wildcard characters, e.g. use '*.*' mask to count all files in the
       folder; use '*.eml' mask to count files with .EML extension.<br><br>

      <b>Translate macros</b><br>
      With this option enabled you can use special <a href="#macros">date macro variables</a>, <a href="#filespecmacro">file-specific variables</a>
 	   and <a href="actions.htm#udvmacro">User Defined Variables</a> in the folder name and in the file name mask.<br><br>

      <b>Include sub-folders</b><br>
      If the option is disabled, HostMonitor will count files directly in the specified folder. If the option is enabled,
       files in the specified folder and in all of its descending subfolders will be counted.<br><br>

      <b>Conditions to count files</b><br>
      Specify additional condition to count files. Choose one of the options:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> Count all files
       <li> Count files older than NN min
       <li> Count files newer than NN min
       <li> Count files bigger than NN bytes
       <li> Count files smaller than NN bytes
       <li> Count subfolders only 
      </ul><br>

      <b>Alert when folder contains more than NN files</b><br>
      Specify limit for the file amount. When this limit is reached, HostMonitor will change test status to "Bad". If
       you need to start alert actions when file amount become lower than specified, use "<a href="#Reverse">Reverse alert</a>"
       option.<br><br>

      If you want to perform the test using an <a href="rma-unix/index.htm" target="_blank">agent</a> installed on UNIX-like system, you should have in mind:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> use slash (/) in the path (instead of backslash (\) that you are using on Windows systems);
       <li> on UNIX-like systems name of the file is case sensitive (so "/etc/RMA" and "/etc/rma" are different files);
       <li> on Windows system file masks * and *.* represent any file. On UNIX-like system only * represents any file; *.* can be used for any file that has dot (.) in the name;
      </ul><br>
