      A process, in the simplest terms, is an executing program. KharmonMonitor can check specified process on local or remote computer and start alert actions if number of instances of the specified process is out of the defined range. To monitor processes on a remote computer you should use account from Performance Monitor or Administrators group.<br>
	  This test method can processes on Windows and UNIX  systems using SNMP protocol.<br><br>
      Process test has the following options:<br><br>

      <b>Computer name</b><br>
      Specify IP address or name of the target computer.<br><br>

      <b>Process</b><br>
      Type name of the process to check, or select a process from the drop-down list. Also select lower and/or upper
       limit amount of running instances of the specified process, when the limit is reached KharmonMonitor will mark the
       test status as Bad.<br><br>

      <b>Connect as</b><br>
      To check process on remote system you can mark this option and provide a username and a password for a connection
       to the target computer.<br><br>

      Note #1 (Windows): make sure you have RPC and Remote Registry services started on the remote system. 
	  Windows NT 4.0 does not have this service installed by default, however you can find Remote Registry service in the Resource Kit for Windows NT 4.0.
