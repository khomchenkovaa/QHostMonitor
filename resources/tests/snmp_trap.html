     SNMP Trap test method allows you to receive SNMP Trap messages - unsolicited messages from a device (such as router, server) to an SNMP console. Traps might indicate power-up or link-up/down conditions, temperatures exceeding certain thresholds, high traffic, etc. Traps provide an immediate notification for an events that otherwise might only be discovered during occasional polling.<br><br>

     This test method is different from any other. Unlike rest of tests that really test some devices (by sending request and receiving response), SNMP Trap test method was implemented as listener - it does not send any requests. KharmonMonitor listens for incoming messages from network hosts and reacts in real-time.<br>
     That is why time interval fields for this test method are disabled; however you still may use "Schedule" as well as for any other method. KharmonMonitor simply ignores messages that come within restricted time period.<br><br>

	SNMP Trap test has the following options:
     <ul class=list00>
      <li>Bad message <a href="#trapfilter2">filter</a>
      <li>Good message <a href="#trapfilter2">filter</a>
      <li><a href="#trapdisplay">Display</a>
     </ul><br>

     In the "Options" dialog you may specify general Trap Watcher settings and provide special instructions to warn about high SNMP
      traffic from network devices.<br><br>

     <a name="trapfilter"><b>Filters:</b></a><br>
     <br>
     When you setup SNMP Trap test item, you should provide filters (one or more conditions) that will separate "Bad" and "Good" messages. Message passes the filter only when it matches ALL specified requirements of the filter.<br>
     When KharmonMonitor receives message that fits "Bad" filter conditions, it changes status of the test item to "Bad".
      If KharmonMonitor receives message that fits "Good" filter conditions, it changes status of the test item to "Ok".<br>
     Different test items may react on different trap messages. For example one test item may react on router
      configuration changes, while another test reacts on incoming connections received by your firewall.<br>
     It is also possible to change status of the test if no "Bad" (or "Good") trap messages were received within
      specified time interval. For example, you may setup 3rd test item alerting you when a temperature-monitoring
      device does not send any messages for 5 min.<br><br>

    The following options define which situation will be reported as "bad":
     <ul class=list00>
      <li style="text-align=justify"><b>set "Bad" status if received message satisfies...</b><br>
       with this option selected KharmonMonitor will set "Bad" status when received trap message meets all conditions of
       the "Bad" filter.<br>
      </li>
      <li style="text-align=justify"><b>set "Bad" status if no "Good" trap received within NN sec</b><br>
       with this option selected KharmonMonitor will assign "Bad" status to the test item when there were no messages
       received within specified interval of time or when received messages don't meet conditions of the "Good" filter.
      </li>
     </ul><br>

    The same options are available for "Good" messages: 
    <ul class=list00>
     <li>Set "Ok" status if received message satisfies...
     <li>Set "Ok" status if no "Bad" trap received within NN sec
    </ul>
    Plus there is one more option for "Good" status:  
    <ul class=list00>
     <li>Set Ok status by acknowlegement (manually)
    </ul>
    With this option enabled, test item will remain "Bad" until operator <a href="#ack">Acknowledge</a> status 
    (then status will be changed to Ok)<br><br>

    You should provide at least one filter ("Bad" or "Good) or both.<br><br>

     	 
     <b>Increment counters when no messages received</b><br>
	If you are using SNMP Trap test items with "Set Ok status if no Bad trap received within N sec" option, 
	 KharmonMonitor sets "Ok" status to the test item when there are no messages received within specified time 
	 interval or when received messages don't meet conditions of the "Bad" filter.<br> 
	With "Increment counters when no messages received" option enabled KharmonMonitor sets the status AND increments 
	 Recurrences and statistical counters every N seconds. This allows the use of escalation alerts even if 
	 KharmonMonitor does not receives any messages from monitoring device. Of course the same rule applies to 
	 "Set <b>Bad</b> status if no Ok trap received within N sec".
