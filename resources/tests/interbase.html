      HostMonitor can test your SQL servers. It supports Interbase servers.<br>
	  Servers are checked by logging into (and out) of the server. You should specify the server name,  database, user name and password.<br>
	  For Interbase you can specify the protocol (TCP, SPX, or NetBEUI).<br>
      See also <a href="#Dialog">common test parameters</a><br><br>

      In order to monitor Interbase servers HostMonitor uses the Interbase Call Interface (gds32.dll),
      you should have the Interbase client software installed on the computer.<br><br>
      
      Interbase/Firebird test methods may display "unknown" status and appropriate  error message in the Reply field when it was impossible to perform the check (e.g. when client library is not installed).<br><br>
