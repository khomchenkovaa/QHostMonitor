    <h2 align="center" style="color: Black">ODBC Query</h2>
      This test allows you to check the availability of an ODBC data source, run an SQL query, and analyze the value of
       a specified data field in the result set returned. To set up a test, simply pick one of the ODBC data sources
       defined in your system, and fill in the Login, Password and Timeout fields. Optionally, provide an SQL query
       and a condition to check. If no condition is specified, the two possible test status values are "Alive" and
       "No answer". If a condition is provided, test status can be either:
      <ul class="list0">
       <li> "Ok" - if the condition is met;
       <li> "Bad" - if the condition is not met;
       <li> "Unknown" - if the query fails, or the data field specified is not found in the result set.
      </ul><br>

      <b>If field is unavailable, set status</b><br>
      You can use this option to define status of the test in case SQL query was executed without errors but result data 
       set does not contain specified field (specified by row and col parameters). Choose one of the following statuses:
      <ul class="list0">
       <li> Unknown
       <li> Bad
       <li> Ok
      </ul><br>

	<b>Retrieve 2nd field</b><br>
	With this option enabled test may retrieve 2 different fields. KharmonMonitor may check value of field1 and display value of field2 or display field1, also it may display both fields. 
	Also variables %ODBCField1% and %ODBCField2% provide access to retrieved data; variables can be used in 
	 "Optional status processing" expressions or as parameters of actions assigned to ODBC Query test<br><br>

	<b>Display</b><br>
	  
	Note: some ODBC drivers (e.g. MS SQL ODBC Driver version 13.1+) support Integrated Windows authentication and Active Directory Integrated 
	authentication. In this case you may type <span class="samplered">WindowsAuth</span> instead of login name (for Integrated Windows authentication) or set 
	<span class="samplered">ADAuth</span> as login name (for Active Directory Integrated authentication). Password field is not used in such case.<br><br>
	
	<b>Windows x64</b><br>
	KharmonMonitor is 32bit application that can be started on 64bit Windows OS. If you are using Windows x64 Edition and you want to setup 
	 ODBC Logging or ODBC test method, you should setup ODBC datasources using 32-bit ODBC Data Source Administrator (e.g. 
	 C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe).<br>
	There are x86 and x64 versions of RMA (Remote Monitoring Agent) available, so you may use 32-bit or 64-bit version of ODBC Data Source Administrator
	 depending on RMA version.<br><br>

	<span class="samplered"><b>	 <a name="odbc_bugs1">Reliability / Known problems</a></b></span><br>
	If you are using ODBC Query test method or you have setup ODBC logging, you must be sure that ODBC driver (provided by 3rd party) 
	 works reliable and will not cause KharmonMonitor to crash. Some bad ODBC drivers:
    <ul class="list0">
	 <li>Microsoft dBase Driver v 4.00 causes resource leakage; 
	 <li>Oracle drivers v8 and v10 have many "bugs" and may crash application;
	 <li>Old MySQL ODBC drivers v3 cause handles leakage in multithreaded environment. If you have several ODBC Query test items that check 
	  MySQL servers, we recommend to place these test items in separate folder and use "Non-simultaneously test execution"
	  folder-specific option;<br>
	 <li>MySQL ODBC drivers version 8.00.11 - 8.00.15 may lead to various problems as well, including memory access violations. If you need 
	 to use MySQL ODBC driver version 8.x, please set two options in hostmon.ini file, [Misc] section:<br>
		<span class="samplered">[Misc]<br>
		ODBC_UseSharedEnvHandle=1<br>
		ODBC_KeepSharedEnvHandle=1<br></span>
	</ul>
