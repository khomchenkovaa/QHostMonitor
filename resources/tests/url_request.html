      KharmonMonitor can perform  a URL (Universal Resource Locator) check based on the HTTP (web), HTTPS (secure web), FTP or Gopher   protocols.
      To perform URL check KharmonMonitor can connect to a remote server directly or through a proxy server, this proxy server can be defined on the "PROXY" page in the "Options" dialog.<br>
      URL test has the following options:<br><br>

      <u>Basic parameters:</u><br><br>

      <b>URL</b><br>
      Enter the URL you want to monitor. KharmonMonitor is not limited to the retrieval of HTML files for the HTTP and HTTPS checking, it can also retrieve other types of pages, even CGI scripts.<br>
      Examples of URLs include:
      <ul class=list00>
       <LI>http://www.yahoo.com/index.html</LI>
       <LI>https://www.super.secure.server.gov:444/unpublished/mainpage.html</li>
       <LI>ftp://ftp.bhs.com/incoming/list.txt</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Translate date macro variables</b><br>
      This option allows you to use date & time variables in the "URL" and "Post data" fields.
       It is useful when you have to monitor web pages that are created on regular basis. E.g. such URL may look like "<font color="#AA0000"> http://www.sql.company.com/logs/<b>%mm%</b>-<b>%dd%</b>-<b>%yyyy%</b>.html</font>".<br><br>

      <b>Password protected page</b><br>
      Use this option when the URL specified requires a name and password for access.<br>
      <b>User name</b><br>
      If the URL specified requires a name and password for access, enter the user name in this box.<br>
      <b>Password</b><br>
      If the URL specified requires a name and password for access, enter the password in this box.<br><br>

      <br><u>Special parameters:</u><br><br>

      <b>Optional headers</b><br>
		You may specify optional HTTP headers which will be added to the request. For example you can define 
		 cookies using string like "<font color="#AA0000">Cookie: name1=value1; name2=value2; name3=value3</font>".
		 When you send data to the server using POST method, KharmonMonitor automatically inserts "
		 <font color="#AA0000">Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</font>" header.<br><br>

      <b>HTTP POST request</b><br>
		POST requests send data (defined in "Post data" field) to the web server to be processed in some way, 
		like by a CGI script. In this case URL is not a resource to retrieve; it`s usually a program to handle 
		the data you are sending. The HTTP response is normally the program output, not a static file. The most 
		common use of POST is to submit HTML form data to CGI scripts. In this case, the "<font color="#AA0000">Content-Type:</font>"
		header should be set to "<font color="#AA0000">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</font>". So, when you 
		choose "HTTP POST request" option, KharmonMonitor adds this header into "Optional headers" field by default.<br><br>

      <b>Use client certificate</b><br>
		An HTTPS server may require client authentication, in which case a local client certificate should be 
		sent to the server for authentication. Client certificates contain information that identifies the user, 
		as well as information about the organization that issued the certificate.<br>
		"Use client certificate" option allows you to choose certificate that will be sent to the server. If test 
		will be performed directly by KharmonMonitor, application shows list of certificates installed on local 
		system
