      KharmonMonitor can check folder or file size.
      To add this task select the test type "Folder/File Size", enter the folder name and specify a maximum size. You can manually type in the complete path to the folder that you wish to test, or click on the "Browse" button to select the folder.<br>
      If you select the option "Include sub-folders", KharmonMonitor will calculate the size for the folder and all its sub-folders.<br>
      If you need to check some files that are dynamically created and do not have static name (e.g. some logs that
       are created on daily basis and have different file name every day), you may enable "Translate macros" options.<br><br>

      If you want to perform the test using an agent installed on UNIX-like system, you should have in mind:
      <ul class=list00>
       <li> use slash (/) in the path (instead of backslash (\) that you are using on Windows systems);
       <li> on UNIX-like systems name of the file is case sensitive (so "/etc/RMA" and "/etc/rma" are different files);
       <li> on Windows system file masks * and *.* represent any file. On UNIX-like system only * represents any file; *.* can be used for any file that has dot (.) in the name;
      </ul><br>
